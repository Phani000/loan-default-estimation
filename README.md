#Loan Default Estimation

Developing a prediction model for loan default involves collecting historical loan data, preprocessing it by handling missing values and encoding variables, and selecting relevant features like credit scores and employment history. Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost in Python are then trained on this data to predict default risk. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision, and the model’s predictions are used to assess risk and inform decision-making, such as adjusting loan terms or rejecting high-risk applications. Overall, Python’s machine learning libraries enable the development of effective prediction models for risk assessment and lending management.
